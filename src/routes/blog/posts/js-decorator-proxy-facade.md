# Decorator and Facade Patterns in JS

## Decorator

Decorator pattern allows us to mutate the object's behaviors and attributes without modifying it.
With decorator, you can:

1. add pre/post hooks around object's behaviors to do more works before/after.

2. override the behavior

3. rename the behavior
